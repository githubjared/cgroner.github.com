h1. About this site.

Hi, I'm Carl and this is my homepage on the web. I am a computer programmer 
(among other things) from Los Angeles, CA. 

I'm currently using this site to keep track of information that I find 
useful (and hope others may find useful as well). This is mostly related to
computers, programming and information technology in general. 

This site is graciously hosted by git hub as my user page. You can find 
more information about github user pages "here":http://pages.github.com. The source for this site 
is kept "here":https://github.com/cgroner/cgroner.github.com .

h2. Contact.

I can be contacted via <a href="mailto:cgroner@gmail.com?subject=Hi, Carl">email</a> <c.groner@gmail.com> or through my 
<a href="https://github.com/cgroner">github profile</a>.
